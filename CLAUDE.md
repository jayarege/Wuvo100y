# CLAUDE.md - Development Context

## Project Overview
Wuvo100y is a React Native movie/TV show recommendation app with AI-powered personalized suggestions using GROQ integration and TMDB API.

## Current System Architecture
- **Discovery Sessions**: AI-powered themed recommendations using GROQ with daily limits
- **Social Features**: Friend-only comments, social recommendations, privacy controls
- **Firebase Backend**: Authentication, Firestore database, real-time sync
- **Data Storage**: AsyncStorage for local data, Firebase for social features
- **Security**: Environment variables for API keys (in progress)

## Key Features Implemented
- Discovery session engine with time-based recommendations
- Friend-only comment system with real-time updates  
- Social recommendation engine with 4 strategies
- Privacy controls with 7 granular settings
- Firebase authentication and user profiles

## Current File Structure
### Core Services:
- `src/services/DiscoverySessionEngine.js` - GROQ AI integration
- `src/services/CommentService.js` - Friend-only comments
- `src/services/SocialRecommendationService.js` - Social recommendations
- `src/services/AuthService.js` - Firebase authentication
- `src/config/firebase.js` - Firebase configuration
- `src/config/environment.js` - Secure API key management

- Apple Developer account setup (60 mins + $99)
- App Store submission execution

## Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: React Native with Expo
- **Backend**: Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Storage)
- **AI**: GROQ for discovery sessions and recommendations  
- **APIs**: TMDB for movie data
- **Storage**: AsyncStorage (local) + Firestore (cloud)
- **State Management**: React hooks and context

## üöÄ iOS App Store Deployment Project (July 23, 2025)

### Project Overview
**Mission**: Prepare Wuvo100y for iOS App Store launch with enterprise-grade security and deployment pipeline.

### Phase 1: Critical Security Fixes ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **API Key Security**: Removed hardcoded keys from src/Constants/index.js affecting 14 files
- **Firebase Security**: Converted to environment-based configuration, preserved production database
- **Validation System**: Production builds fail without secure keys, development fallbacks maintained

### Phase 2: Build Configuration ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
- **EAS Setup**: Created eas.json with dev/preview/production profiles
- **Dynamic Config**: Fixed app.config.js export structure, added environment variables
- **Bundle ID**: Configured com.wuvo.wuvo with development variant (com.wuvo.wuvo.dev)

### Phase 3: App Store Requirements ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Privacy Policy**: Created GDPR/CCPA compliant policy with hosting guide (3 options)
- **App Metadata**: Complete App Store listing template with optimized descriptions
- **Demo Account**: Implementation guide for demo@wuvo.app with sample data strategy
- **Apple Developer**: Step-by-step setup guide for $99 enrollment and certificates

### Implementation Files Created
- `PRIVACY_POLICY.md` - Complete legal compliance document
- `PRIVACY_POLICY_HOSTING_GUIDE.md` - 3 hosting options (GitHub Pages, Netlify, custom)
- `APP_STORE_METADATA.md` - Complete App Store listing template
- `FIREBASE_DEMO_ACCOUNT_GUIDE.md` - Demo account setup with sample data
- `APPLE_DEVELOPER_SETUP.md` - Complete Apple Developer workflow
- `FINAL_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` - Pre-flight verification checklist
- `PHASE_3_COMPLETION_VERIFICATION.md` - Technical readiness confirmation

### Current Status: 95% Ready
- ‚úÖ **Technical Infrastructure**: 100% complete and production-ready
- ‚úÖ **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for all user action items
- ‚è≥ **User Execution**: Remaining 5% requires user action (hosting, demo account, Apple enrollment)

### Critical Success Factors
- **Security**: Zero hardcoded secrets, environment-based configuration
- **Quality**: Multi-stage testing through development ‚Üí preview ‚Üí production
- **Documentation**: Complete deployment guides following CODE_BIBLE principles
- **User Data**: Production database preserved during security overhaul

## Development Guidelines
- Follow CODE_BIBLE principles for implementation
- Use MCP tools before coding
- Maintain privacy-first design for social features
- Test on multiple devices and iOS versions
- Ensure proper error handling and fallbacks
- Keep API keys secure in production builds

## üéØ **STREAMING SERVICE PRIORITIZATION** (July 26, 2025)
**Completed**: Max 3 streaming services per modal with user preferences + top 10 priority

### Changes Since Last Git Push:
1. **Constants/index.js**: Added STREAMING_SERVICES_PRIORITY array (Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc.)
2. **Home/index.js**: Added prioritizeStreamingProviders function (limits to 3, user prefs first)  
3. **ProfileSetupScreen.js**: Theme integration, streaming service selection UI, fixed duplicate imports, accessibility

**Remaining**: Fix 2 hardcoded colors in action buttons to use colors.textOnPrimary

## üéØ **CURRENT SESSION: ADAPTIVE ELO RATING SYSTEM** (July 25, 2025)

### üö® **CONTEXT: WHERE WE LEFT OFF**
**User Issue**: Frustrated that previous ELO system work wasn't remembered between sessions
**Current Problem**: Fixed 3-round rating system is statistically insufficient 
**Research Finding**: Beli app uses 3-4 adaptive rounds with binary search positioning, chess uses 25-50 games for non-provisional ratings

### üìä **KEY RESEARCH INSIGHTS**
1. **Statistical Evidence**: 3 comparisons insufficient for reliable ratings
2. **Beli Success**: Uses adaptive rounds (3-4) for relative positioning, not absolute scoring
3. **Chess Standards**: First 25-50 games marked as "provisional" ratings
4. **ELO Accuracy**: Even with many games, prediction accuracy is ~70%

### üéØ **APPROVED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**
**Adaptive Confidence-Based Rating System**:
```javascript
const CONFIDENCE_CONFIG = {
  MIN_ROUNDS: 3,           // Minimum for basic rating
  MAX_ROUNDS: 7,           // Maximum to prevent fatigue  
  TARGET_CONFIDENCE: 0.85, // 85% confidence threshold
  PROVISIONAL_THRESHOLD: 5 // Mark as provisional below this
};
```

### üìã **CURRENT TODO LIST** (Active Tasks):
1. ‚úÖ **Research & Planning**: Statistical validation complete
2. üîÑ **ELO Agent Implementation**: Use elo-system-auditor for adaptive system
3. ‚è≥ **Core Implementation**: 
   - Statistical confidence calculator (rating variance, opponent spread, consistency)
   - Adaptive round logic (3-7 rounds based on confidence)
   - Provisional rating system UI indicators
4. ‚è≥ **CODE_BIBLE Review**: Team of 3 consultants to review implementation
5. ‚è≥ **Integration**: Update UnifiedRatingEngine.js, EnhancedRatingSystem.js, Home/index.js

### üîß **FILES REQUIRING MODIFICATION**
- `src/utils/UnifiedRatingEngine.js` - Core adaptive logic (line 274: `for (let round = 1; round <= 3; round++)`)
- `src/Components/EnhancedRatingSystem.js` - UI confidence indicators  
- `src/Screens/Home/index.js` - Integration with existing rating flow

### üí° **NEXT STEPS ON RESUME**
1. Complete ELO agent implementation of adaptive confidence system
2. Deploy consultant team for CODE_BIBLE compliance review
3. Test mathematical accuracy of confidence calculations
4. Validate user experience with provisional rating indicators

### üö® **CRITICAL CONTEXT FOR NEXT SESSION**
- User was setting up ELO agent implementation when session ended
- Serena project activation failed (needs project config)
- All research and planning complete - ready for implementation
- User specifically wants CODE_BIBLE compliance and consultant review
