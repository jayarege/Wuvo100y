# Friends Rating Firebase Implementation - Jan 19, 2025

## COMPLETED
✅ Profile screen tab-based list view transformation

## IN PROGRESS  
❌ Real friends rating from Firebase (currently shows mock TMDB data)

## PROBLEM
- Line 1903, 2017, 2344, 2664: Show `movie.vote_average` instead of real friends ratings
- Need: Average rating from user's actual friends who rated that movie

## TODO
1. Analyze Firebase structure for friends/ratings
2. Create `calculateFriendsRating(movieId, userId)` function  
3. Replace mock data with real calculations
4. Test with multiple users

## FILES
- Modified: `wuvo100y/src/Screens/Profile/index.js`
- Firebase: `wuvo100y/src/config/firebase.js`

## NEXT SESSION
Start with Firebase database structure investigation for friends and ratings collections.
