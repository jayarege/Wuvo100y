# Friends Rating Firebase Implementation - January 19, 2025

## Current Status
✅ **COMPLETED**: Profile screen transformation with tab-based list view
❌ **IN PROGRESS**: Real friends rating calculation from Firebase

## Problem Statement
The Profile screen currently shows mock friends ratings (`movie.vote_average` from TMDB). We need to implement real friends rating calculation that:
1. Fetches all friends of current user from Firebase
2. Gets each friend's rating for a specific movie 
3. Calculates true average of friends who have rated that movie
4. Updates the "FRIENDS" rating display in both tabs

## Current Implementation Issues
- Line 283: `// Mock average friend rating (in real app, this would be calculated from actual friends)`
- Lines 1903, 2017, 2344, 2664: All show `movie.vote_average` instead of real friends ratings
- No Firebase integration for friends data
- No function to calculate average friends rating per movie

## Firebase Database Structure (Need to Investigate)
- Current file: `wuvo100y/src/config/firebase.js` - Basic Firebase v8 setup
- User ID: `currentUserId` (line 220)
- Need to understand:
  - How friends relationships are stored
  - How user ratings are stored per movie
  - Database collections structure

## Implementation Plan
1. **Analyze Firebase structure** - Understand friends and ratings collections
2. **Create friends rating function** - Fetch friends list and their movie ratings
3. **Calculate average** - Get mean rating from friends who rated the movie
4. **Update Profile display** - Replace mock data with real calculations
5. **Test with multiple users** - Verify accuracy across user accounts

## Files Modified Today
- `wuvo100y/src/Screens/Profile/index.js` - Complete tab-based list redesign

## Next Steps
1. Investigate current Firebase database structure for users and ratings
2. Find how friends relationships are currently stored
3. Create `calculateFriendsRating(movieId, currentUserId)` function
4. Replace all `movie.vote_average` with real friends rating in Profile screen
5. Test with multiple user accounts to verify calculations

## Code Locations to Update
- Line 1903: `{movie.vote_average ? movie.vote_average.toFixed(1) : 'N/A'}`
- Line 2017: `{movie.vote_average ? movie.vote_average.toFixed(1) : 'N/A'}`  
- Line 2344: `{movie.vote_average ? movie.vote_average.toFixed(1) : 'N/A'}`
- Line 2664: `{movie.vote_average ? movie.vote_average.toFixed(1) : 'N/A'}`

## Success Criteria
- Friends rating shows actual average of friends who rated the movie
- "N/A" displays when no friends have rated the movie
- Real-time updates when friends add new ratings
- Performance optimized for large friend lists
