# Wuvo100y - Claude Code Session Memory

## Project Overview
Movie rating application with enhanced rating system using ELO-style calculations and movie comparison battles.

## Recent Work Summary (July 3, 2025)

### üö® CRITICAL FIX: Rate Button Modal Issue - COMPLETED
**Problem**: Rate button clicked but emotion selection modal (LOVED/LIKED/AVERAGE/DISLIKED) never appeared
**Root Cause**: Modal stacking conflict - emotion modal rendered behind movie detail modal  
**Solution**: Fixed modal hierarchy and z-index issues

**Files Modified**:
- `src/Screens/Home/index.js`
  - Line 2375: Added `setMovieDetailModalVisible(false)` before opening emotion modal
  - Line 2519: Added `zIndex: 9999` to emotion modal overlay

**Test Status**: Fix applied, awaiting user confirmation

---

### üéØ Baseline-Free Rating System - COMPLETED
**Major Change**: Removed emotion-based starting ratings, implemented pure comparison-based system

**Previous System (Wildcard)**:
- LOVED movies started at 8.5/10
- LIKED movies started at 7.0/10  
- AVERAGE movies started at 5.5/10
- DISLIKED movies started at 3.0/10

**New System (Home Screen)**:
- First comparison: Unknown vs Known (no baseline)
- Rating derived from battle outcome: opponent_rating ¬± 0.5
- Subsequent rounds: Known vs Known using Wildcard ELO logic

**Key Implementation**:
```javascript
// Round 1: Unknown vs Known (baseline-free)
if (new_movie_won) {
  derived_rating = min(10, opponent_rating + 0.5);
} else {
  derived_rating = max(1, opponent_rating - 0.5);
}

// Rounds 2-3: Known vs Known (Wildcard ELO)
// Uses adjustRatingWildcard() function
```

### üìÅ Key File Locations

#### Core Rating Logic
- `src/Screens/Home/index.js` - Main home screen with baseline-free rating system
- `src/Screens/InitialRatingFlow.js` - Alternative rating flow (still uses baselines)
- `src/utils/OpponentSelection.js` - Opponent selection utilities

#### Critical Functions
- `handleEmotionSelected()` - Line 1028, processes emotion selection and starts comparisons
- `adjustRatingWildcard()` - Line 1068, Wildcard ELO calculations for rounds 2-3
- `selectMovieFromPercentile()` - Line 1002, selects opponents based on emotion percentiles
- Rate button `onPress` - Line 2368, triggers emotion modal

#### Modal Components  
- Emotion Modal - Line 2518, LOVED/LIKED/AVERAGE/DISLIKED selection
- Comparison Modal - Line 2567, movie vs movie battles
- Movie Detail Modal - Line 2295, movie information display

---

### üß™ Simulation Results - VALIDATED
Created extensive simulations proving baseline-free system works identically to Wildcard for rounds 2-3:

**Simulation Files Created**:
- `comprehensive_simulation.py` - 3-movie test scenarios
- `mega_simulation.py` - 10-movie comprehensive test  
- `baseline_free_simulation.py` - Direct system comparison
- `homescreen_workflow_demo.py` - Step-by-step workflow
- `extended_simulation.py` - Edge case testing
- `home_vs_wildcard_comparison.py` - Side-by-side analysis

**Key Results**:
- Perfect alignment in rounds 2-3 calculations
- Round 1 differs intentionally (baseline-free vs emotion baseline)
- Opponent selection maintains emotion-based percentiles
- Final ratings reflect pure performance vs opponent quality

---

### üîß Technical Architecture

#### Opponent Selection Logic
```javascript
const percentileRanges = {
  LOVED: [0.0, 0.25],      // Top 25% of user's rated movies
  LIKED: [0.25, 0.50],     // Upper-middle 25-50%
  AVERAGE: [0.50, 0.75],   // Lower-middle 50-75%  
  DISLIKED: [0.75, 1.0]    // Bottom 25%
};
```

#### Rating Flow Workflow
1. **User clicks Rate button** ‚Üí Opens emotion modal
2. **User selects emotion** ‚Üí Triggers `handleEmotionSelected()`
3. **Opponent selection** ‚Üí First from emotion percentile, others random
4. **Round 1: Unknown vs Known** ‚Üí Baseline-free rating derivation
5. **Round 2-3: Known vs Known** ‚Üí Wildcard ELO calculations
6. **Final rating** ‚Üí Based purely on battle performance

#### Error Handling
- Requires minimum 3 rated movies for comparisons
- Enhanced error messages show current movie count
- Graceful fallbacks for insufficient data

---

### üö® Known Issues & Debugging

#### Rate Button Investigation (RESOLVED)
**Problem**: Button clicked but modal didn't appear
**Team Analysis**: 5-engineer debugging session identified modal stacking
**Solution**: Close parent modal first, add z-index priority
**Debugging Added**: Enhanced console logging throughout emotion flow

#### Dependency Cleanup
- Removed `getInitialRatingFromEmotion` from Home screen (still exists in InitialRatingFlow)
- Cleaned up unused imports and variables
- Fixed useCallback dependency arrays

---

### üéÆ User Experience

#### Before (Wildcard System)
- Emotion determined starting rating
- All rounds used same ELO logic  
- Bias toward emotion selection influenced final rating

#### After (Home Screen System)
- Emotion selects opponent difficulty only
- First round pure comparison outcome
- More "fair" - rating based on actual performance
- Removes emotion bias from final ratings

---

### üìä Data Requirements
- **Minimum**: 3 rated movies to enable comparison system
- **Optimal**: 10+ movies for meaningful percentile selection
- **Storage**: Ratings stored with enhanced metadata including comparison history
