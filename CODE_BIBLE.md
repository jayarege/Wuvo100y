# CODE BIBLE

## Claude Code
– Architecture decisions (consider implications)

## Use Git Tools:
– Before modifying files (understand history)
– When tests fail (check recent changes)
– Finding related code (git grep)
– Understanding features (follow evolution)
– Checking workflows (CI/CD issues)

## The Ten Universal Commandments

1. **Thou shalt ALWAYS use MCP tools before coding**

2. **Thou shalt NEVER assume; always question**

3. **Thou shalt write code that's clear and obvious**

4. **Thou shalt be BRUTALLY HONEST in assessments**

5. **Thou shalt PRESERVE CONTEXT, not delete it**

6. **Thou shalt make atomic, descriptive commits**

7. **Thou shalt document the WHY, not just the WHAT**

8. **Thou shalt test before declaring done**

9. **Thou shalt handle errors explicitly**

10. **Thou shalt treat user data as sacred**

## Final Reminders
– Codebase > Documentation > Training data (in order of truth)
– Research current docs, don't trust outdated knowledge
– Ask questions early and often
– Use slash commands for consistent workflows
– Serve documentation on-demand
– Extended thinking for complex problems
– Visual inputs for UI/UX debugging
– Test locally before pushing
– Think simple: clear, obvious, no bullshit

## Remember:
Write code as if the person maintaining it is a violent psychopath who knows where you live. Make it that clear.
